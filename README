seqorrmap : map sequence correlations onto structure
---------------------------------------------

GENERAL
seqorrmap maps sequence-derived residue-pair correlations onto a corresponding PDB structure.
Correlations can be created with the program PSICOV, for example.
It is mandatory to specify a file containing residue pair correlations and a PDB file
that contains the same sequence the correlations were derived for.
seqorrmap verifies that (adjusted) sequence numbers given in the correlation file exist
in the structure and that the amino acid types match. 
If residues in the correlation file cannot be mapped, the program warns or exits,
depending on the strictness settings (see below).
Two switches are provided to adjust alignment (transformation) of residues of 
the sequence in the correlation file with residues contained in the structure:
'firstSeqResidue' and 'firstStrResidue'.

The first residue number of the correlation file is '0' by definition and 
ususally that sequence starts with a residue that is contained in the structure.
In this case, only 'firstStrResidue' needs to be provided to obtain a correct alignment,
where 'firstResidue' is the residue position in the structure file that corresponds to the
first ('0') residue in the correlation file.
Otherwise, if the correlation sequence starts N-terminal to the structure,
'firstSeqResidue' needs to be provided additionally
(keeping in mind to start the residue count in the correlation file at '0').

It is crucial to check the output logs for mapping errors.

FILTERS
seqorrmap provides a range of selection filters to focus the analysis on specific
sets of correlations. 
Correlations can be filtered by the following selection criteria: 
- sequence distance between correlated residues: sLoCutoff < seq. distance < sUpCutoff
- correlation strength between correlated residues: cLoCutoff < correlation < cUpCutoff
- radius (spatial distance) between correlated residues: rLoCutoff < radius < rUpCutoff
- residue selection lists. Residue numbers in the selection lists refer to those of the structure.
  There are two residue selection lists, specified by the command line switches:
  '--select1' to select the range of first residues in correlated residue pairs, and
  '--select2' to select equivalently the range of second residues.
  An example for a residue selection looks like this:
  --select1 A:5-6 A:19 --select2 B:50
  This would select only correlations with residues A:5, A:6 and A:19 as first
  residues and B:50 as second residue in a residue-pair correlation.

Note that the numbering in selection lists refers to the PDB structure numbering.

ADVANCED MAPPING FOR REPLICAS
Sometimes protein assemblies are composed of repeated identical replicas,
which have the same chain ID names. To differentiate between the individual replicas 
in the mapping process, one can use the '--systemChain' switch. This triggers
the program to use an internal chain numbering system running invariably like 'A','B',...
for the given chains, where a new chain is detected during input whenever chain ID 
in the PDB file changes and/or a 'TER' flag is enccountered.
These internal chain names are then printed to the terminal 
output (stdout). When '--systemChain' is given, the user needs to use the 
internal chain names in the selection strings of '--select1' and '--select2'.

VMD
Those correlations that pass the filters are selected and printed out (--corrOut).
A Tcl script is generated to map the selected correlations onto the structure for 
visualisation (--tclOut).
The VMD program can be used to load the Tcl script.

CONSISTENCY
seqorrmap checks for the existence of the input data correlations in the target structure
on the basis of the specified sequence positions and amino acid types. 

'--strict_nr' triggers the program to exit if the residue numbers specified in
the correlation input data line (adjusted by --firstResidue)
cannot be mapped onto the target structure, otherwise the program's 
default behaviour is to skip the input data line and to continue.

'--strict_aa' triggers the program skip the input data line if the specified 
amino acids are not found in the target structure, otherwise the default behaviour is
to map the contact and print a warning about the amino acid mismatch.

OUTPUT
'seqorrmap.out' contains detailed information about all successfully mapped correlations.
'seqorrmap.err' contains detailed information about all UNsuccessfully mapped correlations.
'seqorrmap_corr.dat' contains the list of (cutoff-)selected correlations.
'seqorrmap.vmd' contains a TCL script to plot the structure and selected correlations in VMD.
'seqorr.mat' contains a symmetric matrix of corralation values scaled to the value range [-1 1].
'seqorrcomp.mat' is alike, but scaled to the value range [0 1] and expressed as complement 1 - [0 1].


Install / Uninstall
-------------------
Please read the general 'INSTALL' instructions.
The configuration option '--enable-debug' creates a debuggable binary.
The option '--enable-profiling' enables profiling with 'gprof'. 

For code documentation execute 'doxygen doxygen.cfg' in the 'src' directory.
Documentation files are created in 'doc/html' and 'doc/latex'.
The latex documentation is completed by executing 'make pdf' in the 
'doc/latex' directory, which creates 'refman.ps' and 'refman.pdf'.

A typical execution line would look like this:

The same with logging of the stdout and stderr streams:
seqorrmap --pdbIn 0XYZ.pdb --corr seqorr_corr.dat --cLoCutoff 0.8 > >(tee stdout.log) 2> >(tee stderr.log >&2)
